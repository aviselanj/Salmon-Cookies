# Salmon-Cookies

## Problem Domain

Pat has come up with a business idea by combining his love for sweets and his passion for healthy ecosystems. Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. These cookies made into the shape of a salmon and are suitable for both humans and salmon to enjoy.

Patâ€™s Salmon Cookies, soon with franchises internationally.
Pat needs some help with the branding of the business, as well as some help with internal data management for the company.

I need to build a proof of concept application to calculate the number of cookies each location must make every day so that it can manage its supplies inventory and baking schedule.
